# You're off to great places
You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And **YOU** are the guy who'll decide where to go.

And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.
